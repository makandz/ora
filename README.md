# Ora üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ora is a minimalist yet powerful Pomodoro timer built for focus and flow. Unlike traditional timers, Ora rewards you with break time as you work, and incentivizes deep focus with bonus breaks over longer sessions.

## Getting Started

```
npm install --force
npm run dev
```

`--force` is needed because of some issues with ShadCN and React 19.
